    <h1>Collatz Sequence Summary</h1>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
        For n = 71, the next Collatz number is n' = 107, represented in binary as: <br>
        n (71) = 1000111 <br>
        n' (107) = 1101011 <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        This example demonstrates how the Collatz sequence progresses. Starting with n = 71, we reach n' by applying the rules defined in the Collatz conjecture.
